    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Exercise](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-clients/supplement/0oDtw/working-with-labs-in-this-course) for guidance on viewing your code, instructions related to the Jupyter notebook environment, as well as how to access the MySQL database in it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites: \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this lab, you need to install Python and MySQL. Then you need to install MySQL Connector/Python client or API on your Python environment. Follow the instructions in previous videos to install the required packages or software.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To work with MySQL using Python, you must have an authorized user account on the MySQL server.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario: \n",
    "\n",
    "Little Lemon’s guests need to access the database for any booking or inquiry, for example, reading the menu. Little Lemon, therefore, needs to establish a connection between the Python and MySQL databases for every operation.  Establishing a connection every time is resource intensive and it is affecting the performance of the Little Lemon application. To improve the performance of the application, Little Lemon needs to establish a pool of database connections to facilitate the guests’ inquiries to the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked to help Little Lemon to create a pool of database connections using Python. "

    "Create a database connection pool with three connections available for the users to connect. You need to import MySQLConnectionPool class and pass the following arguments: \n",

    "* pool_name = “ll_pool_a” \n",

    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Use try-except block from Python to implement the error handling. Once the connection pool is created, use the print statements to display the name of the pool and the number of connections in it.  "
